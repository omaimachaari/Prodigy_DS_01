# Data Visualization Using Bar Chart or Histogram (Excel) #
Objective:
Using Excel, I created a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as age or gender in a population.

Steps Taken:

Data Cleaning: Removed any irrelevant or missing data points.
Feature Engineering: Transformed data by adding necessary features for analysis.
Grouping: Grouped the data by relevant categories (e.g., age ranges or gender) to better visualize distribution.
